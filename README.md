# CollapCSS

This is just a python script intended to collapse CSS files. The idea for this emerged from when I was writing CSS and wanted to maximize reuseability. Especially for larger CSS projects, there came a time when managing that reusability was taking longer than actually solving the problem. The intended use of this program is to let the user write CSS with very little code reuseability in mind and then to use this program to maximize the code reuseability.

# Current

Empty. Does nothing.

# Future Goals

To have a basic working prototype.
To also do an ExpandCSS which is intended to completely seperate different classes, attributes, ids, etc.
